</p>

<h2>Logical Security</h2>
<p>Access to virtual machines (VMs) is strictly limited to authorized company administrators. We use authenticated login pages and encryption technologies to ensure that your data remains secure and undisturbed. These logical security measures are crucial in maintaining the integrity and privacy of your interactions with our services.</p>
